          <p>Itachi Uchiha, age four. After seeing what occurs on the battlefield up close, he makes a certain decision. He decided that he would change the world. The dream that Itachi aimed for. His dream: A Hokage from the Uchiha clan, and a
            future
            where those he loved could live in peace. His time in the ninja academy, his meeting with Shisui, becoming a Genin, Chunin, and finally a member of the Anbu. Itachi ran straight down a path of glory, not knowing that a cruel darkness
            was
            spreading. This is the story of the glory, frustration, and determination of the ninja called a genius.</p>

          <p>Itachi was a highly perceptive child, wise beyond his years and spent much of his time researching the history of the village from the writings their ancestors left behind. Because of this, Itachi was never limited to the view of his
            own
            clan but worried about the fate of the village as a whole. Later the third hokage confirms this by saying "even at the age of seven, he had the thinking of a Hokage".</p>

          <p>Uchihas were initially descendants of Indra Otsutsuki who believed in power. After being felt as treated secondary to Senju clan in the village as none of the Uchicha ever became a Hokage or attained a valued position in the village
            they
            bred more hatred towards the village and decided to rebel.The current Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi and Lord Danzo had knowledge of this and ordered complete annihilation of Uchiha Clan, as if they emerge to pull out a war it was going to
            restart
            the endless series of clan wars just like it was before establishment of Konoha.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Itachi had complete understanding of the consequences. He even at the tender age of 13 exceeded in wisdom and skill than most higher level shinobis. Danzo was after Shishui Uchiha's eyes and to save the name of clan Shishui commits
            suicide
            and hands over his eye to Itachi, and takes a promise from him that he will save the Uchiha name and Konoha at all cost. Danzo had meticulously planned Uchiha's end via hands of Itachi. Itachi without a word of pain, accomplishes his
            mission
            sparing none, except his younger brother. He even kills his own parents, while his hands were shaking and he was trembling with pain within.</p>

          <p>
            From being a prodigy who would have rightly earned his place as the Fifth Hokage to a rogue ninja hated by every one, and no one ever knew how great Itachi's sacrifice is! Its something we as normal humans are unable to comprehend,
            the
            pain
            that his heart must have felt while slaughtering his own clan-mates, his own comrades. He lost his clan, his pride, his love, seeded hatred in his brother, his best friend committed suicide. The extent of pain Itachi endured and his
            will to
            protect the same village which despises him is beyond comprehension.</p>
